\Acknowledgements{
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Vasiliy, for his patience and continuous support as I changed the scope of my thesis over and over, well into February. Also go us for getting the biggest sample size in a thesis, maybe ever?

Additionally, thank you to Greg for helping me figure out how to use magic i.e.~use PCA, which I think most people will probably end up thinking is magic but whatever. It's just an undergraduate thesis. Sorry that I stopped coming to class but still came to your office hour for thesis help haha.

I would also like to thank my roommate and best friend Isaac for revealing to me the true, nefarious purpose of homosexuality, which I am now sworn to take to the grave without telling another soul. Also thanks for cooking me dinner almost every day for that two week period where I didn't go to class and just worked on my thesis and talked about girls. You are the truly the best fag a dyke could ask for.

Also, thank you to my pal of pals and thesis desk partner Lou, who, regardless of the pronouns I was in to, was always by side and down to banter in a variety of accents and codes for four straight years! Four years! Alright! Cheerio!

Thank you to Riley who accompanied me in IRL life, and then via FaceTime as the pandemic fell over Oregon, in my descent into madness as I began realizing that, while the semester was ending, the completion thesis was not. You're quite funny \emph{very} pretty, \emph{even} for a tranny. See you tomorrow.

Thank you to Jay who transitioned from cycling buddy to R Markdown buddy as you graduated and I started thesis. Hopefully we can detransition soon.

Thank you to all of my dear gender-diverse feminists: Io, Schuster, Nell, and Zoe. While I don't think we actually settled on a definition of ``gender diverse,'' I'm glad that we were able to exercise that term enough for me to feel confident using it in my thesis title and never define it in the text.

Thank you to Paulina, whose overflowing passion for fancy liquids and weird modern classical music knows no geographical bounds i.e.~not Oregon i.e.~Chicago. Let's do that again sometime.

Thank you to Vivek, whose camradery in high quality music and appreciation for Paul was a continuous sorce of joy over the years. It's a shame you chose the worse major---neuroscience---so we'll never truly be on equal footing, but I see you and I appreciate you. Also thanks for your short-lived TA role with Beef Tip helping us teach Ophelia to press the lever on her \emph{other} right.

Thank you to Saxton, who \emph{also} sat with me on the lawn as the world switched up it vibes. Because I got an extension on my thesis, I have the privlege of ripping your acknowledgement text for mine.

Thank you to Saga who entertained bit after bit in the PARC when they really had no choice because they were at work. Also thank you for finally revealing the author's rhetorical purpose in your thesis. While I don't personally grasp what ``g*y s*x'' means, I trust you and the personal significance it holds for you.

Thank you to my dear Reed College dolls: Mia, Beatrice, and Winn. How very feminist of us to queer higher-ed and our small liberal arts college in the Portland Northwest by transitioning while studying. Stunning.

Thank you to the REED COLLEGE LOW BRASS SECTION! We really brought that Reed College sound for FOUR YEARS in a row! Don't you all remember four years ago? With Yuan? Anyone? Thank you to all of the Low Brass underclassmen, Henry, Jon, and Gloria, who bought Ryen and I pizza seemingly every night this semester until the 2019--20 coronavirus pandemic put a halt to all of that.

Thank you to Kristin, whose continuous encouragement, support, and interest in my work in and out of the mLab pushed me to new levels.

Thank you to Dr.~Kelly ``Preisdent of Solid Air'' Chacón PhD Esq., whose, frankly, \emph{rediculous} tollerance of my bits blossomed into a wonderful friendship. In your own words, I now know neither physics nor chemistry. But, I have a friend. Additionally, thank you to Luke and Pax for your impressive and continuous commitment to the bit. Also hi Alex!

Thank you also to everyone who attended the Tuesday Transgender injection Zoom meeting, including Benjamin, Shaan, Iris, Maddox, Beq, Winn, and August. How cool of us to be transgender in the time of COVID.

Thank you to the many people who sent me kind words of encouragement when I was frustrated that the pronouns just weren't adding up. There are too many of you to thank, but I appreciate all of you and you help lift this thesis to what it is today.

Thank you KDFC, for continuously entertaining me from 8:30am-ish to 10-10:30-ish every day for the past four years. I have but one small suggestion: please replace the Classical Commuter Quiz and the Musical Blind Date with additional segments of Mozart in the Morning, they are not necessary and Mozart is better. Thanks.

And most importantly, to Tuesday, as in the day of the week. You were always there for me. Truly you make the natiform indent in meaning that falls between Monday and Wednesday. Thanks, Tuesday.

\Abstract{
Gendered third-person pronouns such as ``she'' are used to refer to people in a manner that is congruent with their gender. For many cisgender people, this is an unquestioned truth. However, for transgender and non-binary people, correct use of one's gendered pronouns can be as important as one's chosen name. Transgender literature has not yet examined relationships with gendered pronouns in detail. In this study, we developed a survey about relationships with and attitudes towards gendered pronouns. Additionally, two previously validated measures of gender congruence and active support of transgender people were included in the survey. This was administered to undergraduates at Reed College, where a significant proportion of the student body is gender non-confirming, transgender, and non-binary. The sample also includes cisgender people. We found that pronouns are a poor signifier of gender, and that people of all genders use many different combinations of pronouns. Furthermore, we found that relationships to pronouns is complicated and multivariate. Using primary component analysis, we found that a significant proportion of the data can be explained by how deeply one is affected by cisnormativity---the systematic privileging of cisgender people. Ultimately, relationships to pronouns are complicated and deeply individual. We also found that cis people generally lag behind trans and non-binary people in supporting trans people. One concrete way that cis people can support their trans peers is by initiating the sharing of pronouns.

477 undergraduates from Reed College participated in this study. Their median age was 20 (\emph{M} = 20.14, \emph{SD} = 1.32). A majority of participants identified as White (74.2\%). The sample also included 9.4\% mixed ethnicity, 7.1\% Asian, 1.7\% Black or African American, and 1.3\% Hispanic/Latino participants. 5.9\% of participants preferred not to disclose their ethnicity. When compared to data on first year students' ethnicity, this sample appears to be approximately representative of the population (Reed College Institutional Research, 2019).

There were 102 first years, 118 second years, 131 third years, and 120 fourth years in the sample. There were 38 majors represented in the sample, including 15 majors with 10 or more students represented. The most common majors were psychology (\emph{N} = 32), biology (\emph{N} = 27), anthropology (\emph{N} = 26), english (\emph{N} = 24), political science (\emph{N} = 21), chemistry (\emph{N} = 19), linguistics (\emph{N} = 19), comparative literature (\emph{N} = 18), history (\emph{N} = 18), and computer science (\emph{N} = 17).

\hypertarget{gender}{%
\subsection{Gender}\label{gender}}

Gender-related demographic data was collected by asking participants to write in their gender identity and answer a series of yes/no questions: ``Are you cisgender?,'' ``Are you transgender?,'' and ``Is your gender non-binary?'' Answering yes on one question did not force the participants to answer no on others---this treated gender identity as a collection of separate, related labels that participants may or may not identify with simultaneously. Responses for the write-in question were qualitatively coded by the author.

Overall, 317 participants identified as cisgender, 81 identified as transgender, and 141 identified their gender as non-binary. It is important to note that there is overlap among these groups. 63 participants said they were transgender and non-binary, 16 participants said they were cisgender and non-binary, and 1 participant said they were cisgender, transgender, and non-binary.

Qualitative themes were decided by the author after examining the data. She used her own knowledge of gender terminology, as well as the help of a number of transgender and non-binary peers. The most commonly occurring themes were woman (\emph{N} = 220), man (\emph{N} = 120), non-binary (\emph{N} = 94), cisgender (\emph{N} = 36), transgender (\emph{N} = 26), questioning (\emph{N} = 24), masculine (\emph{N} = 18), agender (\emph{N} = 15), genderfluid (\emph{N} = 15), and queer (\emph{N} = 8).

For the purposes of analysis, seven \emph{artificial} gender groups were created: cisgender man, cisgender woman, transgender man, transgender woman, cisgender non-binary person, non-binary person, and transgender non-binary person. It is important to note that these bins are artificial and are not representative of each individual's own gender and experience. For example, ``non-binary'' can have many meanings and is best understood as an umbrella term that encompasses many genders, including individuals whose gender is just ``non-binary.''
\begin{longtable}[t]{lr}
\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-1}Artificial gender bins created for the purpose of analysis.}\\
\toprule
Gender Bin & N\\
\midrule
Cis Woman & 182\\
Cis Man & 101\\
Non-binary & 80\\
Trans Non-binary & 48\\
Trans Woman & 20\\
\addlinespace
Cis Non-binary & 15\\
Trans Man & 12\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
The cisgender man and cisgender woman groups include all participants that only indicated that they were cisgender and indicated that they were a man or woman in the write-in gender field. The transgender man and transgender woman groups were the same as the cisgender groups, but included participants who indicated that they were transgender.

The cisgender non-binary group includes all participants who indicated that they were cisgender and non-binary. This group includes cisgender non-binary men and cisgender non-binary women. The non-binary group includes all participants that only indicated that they were non-binary, as well as participants who indicated that they were neither cisgender nor transgender. This group includes non-binary men and non-binary women. The transgender non-binary group includes all participants that indicated that they were non-binary and transgender. This group includes transgender non-binary men and transgender non-binary women.

\hypertarget{pronouns}{%
\subsection{Pronouns}\label{pronouns}}

Participants were asked their pronouns in a write-in box. Pronouns were qualitatively coded by the author. No participants reported using any other pronouns besides he/him, she/her, and they/them. However, many participants reported using multiple pronouns. It should be noted that individuals that use multiple pronouns may prefer one over the other, or use different pronouns in specific situations. This is not reflected in these data.
\begin{longtable}[t]{lr}
\caption{\label{tab:cockandballs}Participant pronouns}\\
\toprule
Pronouns & N\\
\midrule
she/her & 199\\
he/him & 127\\

he/him \& they/them & 19\\
\addlinespace
all pronouns & 10\\
he/him \& she/her & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
The most common gender and pronoun combinations were cisgender women that used she/her, (\emph{N} = 175), cisgender men that used he/him, (\emph{N} = 96), transgender non-binary people that used they/them, (\emph{N} = 32), non-binary people that used they/them, (\emph{N} = 28), non-binary people that used she/her and they/them, (\emph{N} = 16), trans men that used he/him, (\emph{N} = 12), and trans women that used she/her, (\emph{N} = 11).

\hypertarget{sexuality}{%
\subsection{Sexuality}\label{sexuality}}

Participants were asked to report their sexuality in a write-in field. Responses were qualitatively coded by the author. Many responses were coded with multiple themes, so the total \emph{N} exceeds the sample size. One exceptionally common response was ``bisexual/pansexual,'' (\emph{N} = 11), which was coded with both themes.
\begin{longtable}[t]{lr}
\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-2}Participant sexuality}\\

Sexuality & N\\
\midrule
Bisexual & 178\\

Questioning & 39\\
\addlinespace
Gay & 35\\
Lesbian & 35\\
Asexual & 16\\
Aspec & 15\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
``Aspec'' was an umbrella term for sexual orientations that fell under the asexual/aromatic umbrella. Tese were a variety of orientation that involved the split sexuality/romantic attraction model (Mod J, 2017). Additionally, 3 participants described their sexuality as demisexual, 2 as polyamourous, and 1 as enbian. Some terms, such as ``gynophile,'' were coded as ``straight'' or ``queer'' depending on the participant's gender.

The most common gender and sexualities were bisexual cisgender women, (\emph{N} = 70), straight cisgender men, (\emph{N} = 56), straight cisgender women, (\emph{N} = 50), bisexual non-binary people, (\emph{N} = 33), bisexual cisgender men, (\emph{N} = 26), and bisexual transgender non-binary people, (\emph{N} = 23).

\hypertarget{experiences-with-misgendering}{%
\section{Experiences with Misgendering}\label{experiences-with-misgendering}}

Similar to McLemore (2015), we had participants report how frequently they were misgendered and how stigmatized it made them feel. However, unlike McLemore (2015), we administered these questions to cisgender people as well. Independent t-tests were used to compare the cisgender and non-cisgender participants. Non-cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 3.28, \emph{SD} = 0.96) reported being misgendered more frequently than cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 1.45, \emph{SD} = 1.45), \emph{t}(231) = 21.6, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.
Non-cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 3.15, \emph{SD} = 1.3) also reported feeling more stigmatized when misgendered than than cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 1.59, \emph{SD} = 1.59), \emph{t}(261) = 12.9, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.
\begin{longtable}[t]{lrr}
\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-3}Misgendering frequency for non-cisgender and cisgender participants}\\
\toprule
“How often do people ‘misgender’ you?” & Non-cisgender (\%) & Cisgender (\%)\\
\midrule
Never & 6.4 & 68.8\\
Rarely & 14.0 & 24.9\\
Sometimes & 30.6 & 4.7\\
Often & 44.6 & 1.3\\
Always & 4.5 & 0.3\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
\begin{longtable}[t]{lrr}
\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-4}Felt stigma when misgendered for non-cisgender and cisgender participants}\\
\toprule
“I feel stigmatized (...) when I am misgendered.” & Non-cisgender (\%) & Cisgender (\%)\\
\midrule
Not at all & 12.2 & 68.5\\
Slightly & 20.5 & 12.0\\
Somewhat & 28.2 & 13.4\\
Considerably & 18.6 & 4.0\\
Very & 20.5 & 2.2\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
Pearson's Chi-squared tests were used to compare the misgendering frequency observed in McLemore (2015) to the non-cisgender participants in the present study.
There were significant differences when compared to both the study 1 population, \emph{X\textsuperscript{2}} (4, \emph{N} = 864) = 178.18, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and the study 2 population, \emph{X\textsuperscript{2}} (4, \emph{N} = 902) = 228.69, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

We performed a one-way ANOVA examining gender and pronouns' effect on misgendering frequency and felt stigma. There was a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 428) = 131.73, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and pronouns, \emph{F}(6, 428) = 12.53, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, on misgendering frequency. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that cis men, (\emph{M} = 1.3, \emph{SD} = 0.5), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 1.36, \emph{SD} = 0.62), get misgendered less frequently than trans men, (\emph{M} = 3.25, \emph{SD} = 0.87), trans women, (\emph{M} = 3.5, \emph{SD} = 0.95), cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 2.07, \emph{SD} = 1.28), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.03, \emph{SD} = 1.06), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.56, \emph{SD} = 0.77). Cis non-binary people also get misgendered less than trans men men, trans women, non-binary people, and trans non-binary people. Trans non-binary people also get misgendered more than non-binary people. Additionally, people who use they/them pronouns, (\emph{M} = 3.71, \emph{SD} = 0.82), get misgendered more than people who use he/him pronouns, (\emph{M} = 1.6, \emph{SD} = 0.94), she/her pronouns, (\emph{M} = 1.48, \emph{SD} = 0.79), both he/him and they/them pronouns, (\emph{M} = 2.84, \emph{SD} = 1.01), and both she/her and they/them pronouns, (\emph{M} = 2.66, \emph{SD} = 1.08).

There was also a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 389) = 43.4, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, but not of pronouns, \emph{F}(6, 389) = 0.74, \emph{p} = 0.61, on felt stigma when misgendered. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that cis men, (\emph{M} = 1.42, \emph{SD} = 0.88), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 1.67, \emph{SD} = 1.05), feel less stigmatized when misgendered than trans men, (\emph{M} = 4.25, \emph{SD} = 0.75), trans women, (\emph{M} = 3.45, \emph{SD} = 1.54), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 2.59, \emph{SD} = 1.09), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.62, \emph{SD} = 1.23). Cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 1.87, \emph{SD} = 0.99), also feel less stigmatized when misgendered than trans men, trans women, and trans non-binary people. Non-binary people also feel less stigmatized when misgendered than trans men and trans non-binary people.

\section{Gender Congruence}\label{gender-congruence}}

Kozee, Tylka, \& Bauerband (2012) developed the TCS (Transgender Congruence Scale) to measure transgender individuals' relationship and comfort between their inner gender identity, physical appearance, and social experience of gender. In this study, the TCS was administered to cisgender participants as well.

A single sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 34.26, \emph{SD} = 5.5) scored lower on the TCS than cisgender participants (\emph{M} = 45.53, \emph{SD} = 6.23), \emph{t}(348.89) = -20.04, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

A one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant effects of gender on TCS scores, \emph{F}(6, 445) = 71.24, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that cis men, (\emph{M} = 46.19, \emph{SD} = 5.55), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 45.98, \emph{SD} = 5.8), have significantly higher TCS scores than trans men, (\emph{M} = 36.08, \emph{SD} = 2.84), trans women, (\emph{M} = 35.11, \emph{SD} = 4.12), cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 37.93, \emph{SD} = 9.05), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 33.97, \emph{SD} = 5.89), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 33.94, \emph{SD} = 5.81).

A possible relationship between congruence and misgendering frequency was explored. A factorial ANOVA revealed that congruence had a significant effect on misgendering frequency, \emph{F}(1, 424) = 136.56, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001 and felt stigma when misgendered, \emph{F}(1, 424) = 69.06, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, but not frequency and stigma when combined as a single factor, \emph{F}(1, 424) = 0.2, \emph{p} = 0.65.

\section{Transgender Inclusive Behaviors}\label{transgender-inclusive-behaviors}}

Kattari, O'Connor, \& Kattari (2018) developed the Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale (TIBS) as a method of quantifying the number of behaviors that may support and include transgender people that one regularly does. Scores are a sum of responses on a series of five-point likert scales ranging from ``Never'' to ``Often.''

An independent samples t-test revealed that non-cisgender people (\emph{M} = 51.34, \emph{SD} = 9.14) reported performing more inclusive behaviors than cisgender people (\emph{M} = 41.98, \emph{SD} = 9.26), \emph{t}(304) = 10.22, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that there was a significant effect of gender \emph{F}(6, 260) = 26.14, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.
A Tukey post-hoc comparison revealed that cisgender men (\emph{M} = 37.31, \emph{SD} = 8.92) do significantly fewer trans inclusive behaviors than cisgender women (\emph{M} = 44.43, \emph{SD} = 8.18), transgender men (\emph{M} = 55.91, \emph{SD} = 9.16), transgender women (\emph{M} = 50.58, \emph{SD} = 9.97), cisgender non-binary people (\emph{M} = 45.73, \emph{SD} = 8.18), non-binary people (\emph{M} = 49.26, \emph{SD} = 9.3), and transgender non-binary people (\emph{M} = 53.85, \emph{SD} = 7.71). Cisgender women do significantly fewer trans inclusive behaviors than transgender men, transgender women, non-binary people, and transgender non-binary people. Cisgender non-binary people also do fewer trans inclusive behaviors than transgender non-binary people.

Items 1 (``I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in most settings''), 2 (``I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in non-academic settings in the Reed community''), 3 (``I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in classes at Reed''), 7 (``I feel more comfortable sharing my pronouns if I am with people who may have similar gender identities to me''), 8 (``I feel more comfortable introducing myself with my pronouns if someone else does first''), and 9 (``I feel more comfortable introducing myself with my pronouns in class if the professor does first'') touched on participant's comfort sharing their pronouns.
A one-way ANOVA found a significant effect of setting, \emph{F}(2, 1311) = 16.39, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, gender, \emph{F}(6, 1311) = 40.08, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and pronouns, \emph{F}(6, 1311) = 19.19, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, on comfort sharing pronouns. A post-hoc Tukey test found that generally, students are more comfortable sharing pronouns in class, (\emph{M} = 4.5, \emph{SD} = 0.98), and in non-academic settings at Reed, (\emph{M} = 4.43, \emph{SD} = 1.07), than they are in general, (\emph{M} = 4.14, \emph{SD} = 1.31). It also found that cisgender men, (\emph{M} = 4.65, \emph{SD} = 0.78), are more comfortable sharing their pronouns than trans men, (\emph{M} = 4.11, \emph{SD} = 1.24), trans women, (\emph{M} = 3.22, \emph{SD} = 1.51), and non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.66, \emph{SD} = 1.4).

One-way ANOVAs were used on each setting to elucidate effects of gender and pronoun within each setting. There were significant effects of gender in general, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 34.7, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, in non-academic settings at Reed, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 9.07, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and in class, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 19.93, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. There were also significant effects of pronouns in general, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 34.7, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, in non-academic settings at Reed, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 9.07, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and in class, \emph{F}(6, 435) = 19.93, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

\end{figure}
Post-hoc Tukey tests were used to compare gender groups within each setting. In a general setting, cis men, (\emph{M} = 4.53, \emph{SD} = 0.93), were more comfortable sharing their pronouns than trans women, (\emph{M} = 4.76, \emph{SD} = 0.68), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.02, \emph{SD} = 1.5), and transgender non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.25, \emph{SD} = 1.49). In addition, cis women, (\emph{M} = 4.76, \emph{SD} = 0.68) were more comfortable sharing their pronouns than trans men, (\emph{M} = 3.67, \emph{SD} = 1.67), trans women, cisgender non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.87, \emph{SD} = 1.13), non-binary people, and transgender non-binary people. In non-academic settings at Reed, cis men, (\emph{M} = 4.59, \emph{SD} = 0.85), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 4.59, \emph{SD} = 0.85), were more comfortable sharing their pronouns than trans women, (\emph{M} = 3.4, \emph{SD} = 1.6), cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.8, \emph{SD} = 1.52), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 4.04, \emph{SD} = 1.16), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 4.1, \emph{SD} = 1.39). In class, cis men, (\emph{M} = 4.74, \emph{SD} = 0.6), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 4.85, \emph{SD} = 0.53), were more comfortable sharing their pronouns than trans women, (\emph{M} = 3.35, \emph{SD} = 1.57), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.82, \emph{SD} = 1.28), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 4.17, \emph{SD} = 1.14). Cis women were also more comfortable sharing their pronouns than cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 4.4, \emph{SD} = 0.83). Finally, trans women were less comfortable sharing their pronouns than cis non-binary people and trans non-binary people.

A one-way ANOVA was used to examine effects of social factors, gender, and pronouns on comfort sharing pronouns. Specifically, we examined whether people were more comfortable sharing their pronouns when a professor did so first, when someone else did first, and when the participant was with people of similar genders to their own. There were significant effects of social factor, \emph{F}(2, 1311) = 60.03, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, gender, \emph{F}(6, 1311) = 6.95, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and pronouns, \emph{F}(6, 1311) = 15.66, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that someone else saying their pronouns first makes the largest difference in making others comfortable sharing their pronouns. This is followed by the professor sharing their pronouns first, and finally the presence of people of similar genders to one's own.

A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that people's desire to share their pronouns is highest in classroom settings, followed by non-academic settings at Reed, and then lowest in general. Trans men reported a higher desire to share their pronouns than cisgender men, cisgender women, transgender women, cisgender non-binary people, and non-binary people. Transgender non-binary people also reported a higher desire to share their pronouns than cisgender men and non-binary people.

Items 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 were centered around participant's feelings of congruence between their pronouns and other aspects of their gender. We ran one-way ANOVAs examining effects of gender and pronouns on each item with post-hoc Tukey tests where relevant.

On item 13 (``I feel that the gender that people perceive me as and my pronouns are consistent with one another.''), there was a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 449) = 116.89, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. A post-hoc Tukey test found that cis men, (\emph{M} = 4.76, \emph{SD} = 0.6), experience higher consistency than trans men, (\emph{M} = 2.58, \emph{SD} = 1.62), trans women, (\emph{M} = 2.05, \emph{SD} = 1.1), cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.13, \emph{SD} = 1.77), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 2.2, \emph{SD} = 1.27), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 1.85, \emph{SD} = 1.07). Cis women, (\emph{M} = 4.65, \emph{SD} = 0.85), also experience higher consistency than trans men, trans women, cis non-binary people, non-binary people, and trans non-binary people. Cis non-binary people also experience higher consistency than trans women. Finally, cis non-binary people experience higher consistency than non-binary people and trans non-binary people. There were no other significant differences between groups.

On item 14 (``I feel that my internal gender identity and pronouns are consistent with one another.''), there was a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 430) = 18.52, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001 and pronouns, \emph{F}(6, 430) = 3.87, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. A post-hoc Tukey test found that cis men, (\emph{M} = 4.59, \emph{SD} = 0.8), and cis women, (\emph{M} = 4.53, \emph{SD} = 0.93), reported higher consistency than cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.07, \emph{SD} = 1.67), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.23, \emph{SD} = 1.42), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.85, \emph{SD} = 1.34). Trans men, (\emph{M} = 4.5, \emph{SD} = 1.17), also reported higher consistency than cis non-binary people and non-binary people. Trans non-binary people also reported higher consistency than non-binary people. People who use they/them and she/her pronouns, (\emph{M} = 3.03, \emph{SD} = 1.53), reported higher consistency than people who just used they/them pronouns, (\emph{M} = 3.85, \emph{SD} = 1.21). There were no other significant differences between groups.

On item 15 (``I feel that my pronouns represent my gender identity well.''), there was a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 450) = 14.67, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that people correctly assume cis men's, (\emph{M} = 4.56, \emph{SD} = 0.95), and cis women's, (\emph{M} = 4.49, \emph{SD} = 1.09), pronouns more frequently when compared to trans men, (\emph{M} = 2.5, \emph{SD} = 1.17), trans women, (\emph{M} = 2.15, \emph{SD} = 1.04), cis non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.27, \emph{SD} = 1.58), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 2.46, \emph{SD} = 1.2), and trans non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 1.92, \emph{SD} = 0.65). Cis non-binary people's pronouns are also assumed correctly more frequently than trans women's and trans non-binary people.

Item 19 (``In classes at Reed, professors usually introduce themselves with their pronouns'') asked students to report how frequently professors introduced themselves with their pronouns. A one-way ANOVA did not find a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 339) = 1.97, \emph{p} = 0.07, or major, \emph{F}(70, 339) = 1.26, \emph{p} = 0.1, on reported frequency of professors sharing their pronouns. However, when we only compared majors in which we had more than 5 students in, there were significant effects of both gender, \emph{F}(6, 311) = 2.12, \emph{p} = 0.05, and major, \emph{F}(20, 311) = 2.17, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

Item 20 (``In classes at Reed, students usually introduce themselves with their pronouns'') asked students to report how often their peers introduced themselves with their pronouns. A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 339) = 3.67, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, but not major. When we only compared majors that we had more than 5 students in, there were significant effects of gender, \emph{F}(6, 311) = 2.12, \emph{p} = 0.05, and major, \emph{F}(20, 311) = 2.17, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001. It should be noted that this could mean certain genders are more perceptive to others sharing their pronouns, or that some departments make a greater effort to normalize pronoun introductions, or another variable.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method of simplifying a model containing many variables to a small number of components that explain more variation than one component could do alone. We used PCA on the pronoun and misgendering data. Using a Screen plot, we retained three components with an eigenvalue of 3.07, accounting for 52.16\% of the variance.

Inspection of the first component's loadings indicate that consistency between others' perception of one's gender, others' assumptions about gender and pronouns, misgendering, and comfort when with people with similar genders to one's own are making significant contributions to the first component. Because these items are mainly concerned with the assumptions other people place on one's gender and pronouns, this component appears to be the amount that cisnormative assumptions about one's gender and appearance harms individuals.

Loadings from the second component encompasses one's desire to share one's pronouns in various settings, as well as how comfortable one feels doing so. Because the largest loading in the second component is one's desire to share pronouns, this seems to indicate one's readiness to share pronouns.

Loadings from the third component emphasize concern that sharing one's pronouns will draw unwanted attention, as well as when others---not necessarily of the same gender---share their pronouns first and how consistent and representative one's pronouns are with one's gender. This component appears to represent concern around sharing pronouns and fears of judgment or lack of understanding about one's pronouns. While this may seem like the inverse of component 2, it's possible that one may not \emph{want} to share their pronouns, but be relatively unconcerned that doing so would draw unwanted attention or harm. So, we retained component 3 in addition to component 2.

A one-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 377) = 219.3, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001 on the first component. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that cisgender men, (\emph{M} = -2.7, \emph{SD} = 1.05), and women, (\emph{M} = -2.21, \emph{SD} = 1.35), are significantly less affected by cisnormativity than trans men, (\emph{M} = 3.49, \emph{SD} = 2.68), trans women, (\emph{M} = 4.48, \emph{SD} = 2.09), cisgender non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 0.69, \emph{SD} = 2.87), non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.37, \emph{SD} = 2.25), and transgender non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 4.57, \emph{SD} = 1.35). Cisgender non-binary people are also less affected than trans men, trans women, non-binary people, and transgender non-binary people. Trans non-binary people are also more affected than non-binary people. Additionally, results of Spearman correlations indicated a significant negative relationship between the first component and TCS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = -0.72, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and a significant positive relationship with TIBS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = 0.51, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

Visualization of the first component indicated possible bimodality along the first component. Hartigan's dip test indicated that the distribution along the first component is unlikely to be unimodal, (\emph{D} = 0.031, \emph{p} = 0.009). Experiences with cisnormativity may be as bimodal. This indicates that cisgender and non-cisgender people may have significantly different experiences navigating the world as their gender.

Another one-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 377) = 6.14, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001 on the second component. A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that cisgender men, (\emph{M} = -2.7, \emph{SD} = 1.05), are less willing to share their pronouns than cisgender women, (\emph{M} = -2.21, \emph{SD} = 1.35) trans men, (\emph{M} = 3.49, \emph{SD} = 2.68), and non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.37, \emph{SD} = 2.25). Non-binary people are also more willing to share their pronouns than transgender women, (\emph{M} = 4.48, \emph{SD} = 2.09). Additionally, results of Spearman correlations indicated a significant positive relationship between the second component, TCS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = 0.16, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.01, and TIBS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = 0.35, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001.

\end{figure}
A final one-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect of gender, \emph{F}(6, 377) = 4.09, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, TCS scores, \emph{F}(377, 377) = NA, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, and TIBS scores, NA, on the third component. Non-binary people, (\emph{M} = 3.37, \emph{SD} = 2.25), are significantly less concerned that sharing their pronouns will draw unwanted attention than cisgender men, (\emph{M} = -2.7, \emph{SD} = 1.05), cisgender women, (\emph{M} = -2.21, \emph{SD} = 1.35), transgender men (\emph{M} = 3.49, \emph{SD} = 2.68), and transgender women (\emph{M} = 4.48, \emph{SD} = 2.09). There were no significant effects between any other groups. Additionally, results of Spearman correlations indicated a significant positive relationship between the third component, TCS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = 0.15, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.01, and TIBS scores, \emph{rs}(382) = 0.1, \emph{p} = 0.05.

This may be due to the fact that this is the third component which only accounts for 8\% of the total variation. Visualization of the third component shows that there is considerable variation within groups. This may be due to the orthogonal nature of PCA in which it attempts to find the line that explains the greatest amount of variation, given the constraints of the previous components. Given that the first component (cisnormativity) explains the greatest amount of variation, we see less variation in concern around sharing pronouns.
